        <p>
            <em>
                My mother was one of the best cooks I ever knew. <br>
                Whenever she made stews we mostly found homemade dumplings in them. <br>
                We never ate things from packages or microwaves and you sure could taste what food was. <br>
                That's the only way I cook today - I don't use any electronic gadgets to cook with except an electric stove.<br>
