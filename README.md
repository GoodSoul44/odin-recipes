RECIPE WEBSITE!

In this project I practice my HTML knowledge and create simpe site with recipes.

I practice with HTML elements, such as paragraph, lists, images and links.

In result my website provide 4 recipes with info about each meal. It simply, but in future I will made it more pretty by adding CSS styles.
